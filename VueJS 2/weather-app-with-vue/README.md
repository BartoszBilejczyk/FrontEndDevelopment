# weather-app-with-vue

> Weather App which uses OpenWeatherMap API and Vue.js to display current weather. Future versions will allow to search for weather for a given city.

> Due to costly subscription of OWM API for HTTPS and thus my impossibility to render weather data with secure HTTPS request, this app doesn't work within the Internet, only on localhost when the user allows geolocation.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```
